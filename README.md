# VTTconverters

Simple Python utilities to convert .vtt subtitle files to the more common .srt format or cue file format

`USAGE: VTT2SRT filename`   
`where filename is a correctly structured .vtt file`

or:

`USAGE: VTT2Cue filename`   
`where filename is a correctly structured .vtt file`


I may add the capability later to adjust time offsets (eg have the captions start earlier or later).
